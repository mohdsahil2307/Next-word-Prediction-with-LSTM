# Next-word-Prediction-with-LSTM

The aim of this project was to train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model on textual data, in order to suggest the next word in a sequence of words. The model was trained on Shakespear's Hamlet containing about 5000 words. The model was chosen to be LSTM because it works best with sequential data.
